### Accessibility

WCAG 2.1 was published on June 5, 2018.  WCAG 2.2 Draft is scheduled to be finalized in 2023.

#### WCAG 2.2

- [Success Criterion 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#captions-prerecorded): Captions are provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such. 
- [Success Criterion 1.4.2 Audio Control](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-control): If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level. 
- [Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard): All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints. 
- [Success Criterion 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#pause-stop-hide): For moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true:

    Moving, blinking, scrolling

        For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is essential; and

    Auto-updating

        For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.

- [Success Criterion 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#three-flashes-or-below-threshold): Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds.

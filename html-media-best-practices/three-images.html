      <h1>Three Images</h1>
      <p>Three images.  The first two are exported to PNG at maximum resolution and full-size.  The third is a jpg of lower resolution.</p>
      <p>We put each image in a <code>div</code> container with double the height of the viewport.</p>
      <div class="full-vh">
        <img
          src="media/IMG_5082-full-size.png"
          alt="A Florida residential backyard with green trees set against a mostly blue sky on a summer afternoon.  A small, an elongated pond is behind a white fence, with trees lining the other side of the pond.  A portion of a wooden swing set with green plastic joints and the top of a green rope swing is also visible." />

          alt="A lake is in view. The water calmly ripples under a mostly clear, blue South Florida winter sky. The other green, tree-lined shoreline is about a quarter of a mile away. Remote controlled boats can be identified by the small, white jets of water in their wake." />

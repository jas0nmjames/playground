# captions

Experimenting with HTML5's baked in captions.

Created February 2023

## TIL

Things I learned while writing this html:

- [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) prevents captions being loaded when loading the html locally in your browser without serving the page
- Firefox only supports webm and ogg video.  mp4s worked in Chrome and Safari, but not Firefox.  And movs (quicktime) worked in Safari.

      <h1>Image Optimization, Phase 1</h1>
      <p>A single image, but this time in a format and resolution that is web-friendly.</p>
      <p>Using the <code>picture</code> element, we include fallbacks for the webp image format for older browser support.  We also include a fixed width & height to prevent content on the page from jumping around as it calculates a % width and auto height.</p>

          alt="A Florida residential backyard with green trees set against a mostly blue sky on a summer afternoon.  A small, an elongated pond is behind a white fence, with trees lining the other side of the pond.  A portion of a wooden swing set with green plastic joints and the top of a green rope swing is also visible."
